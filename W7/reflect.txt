The inheritance concepts that we had previously discussed in this Milestone 2 session were clear to me. I also had the opportunity to learn more about the intriguing polymorphism of C++. Finally, I was able to use C++'s virtual function. The main definition of a virtual function can be found in the phrase "virtual function" alone.
A virtual function of this type is used in the derived class in place of the base class function. When a virtual function is overridden, the return, type, parameter, and function name of the derived class' virtual function and the base class' virtual function must match.
