I pick up a lot of information, such as the fact that the template function validate() is specified. This method requires four inputs: a boolean array result, a boolean array testValue, a minimum value min, and an array of values testValue. The larger than or equal to (>=) operator is used to compare each member in the testValue array to the minimum value min. The result of this comparison is kept in the appropriate result array index. The function additionally verifies that the data being compared to the valid variable are generally legitimate. The code explains how to validate numerous values simultaneously by using templates and arrays.
