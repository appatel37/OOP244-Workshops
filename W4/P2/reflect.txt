I gained a better understanding of the "this" keyword's meaning thanks to the session. It serves as a pointer to the thing that's currently under construction. When a member variable and a parameter have the same name, the "this" keyword can be used to make the code more readable. For example, a member variable with the same name as a function's parameter can be referenced as "this.name = name" to make it clear which name is being used. Additionally helpful for copying is the word "this."
when using the "return*this" function to return an object, referencing to an object, or working with an object. By explicitly stating to which object a reference is being made with the "this" keyword, the code is made clearer.
