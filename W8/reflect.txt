During this course, I learnt how to build a pure virtual function, create an abstract base class, carry out the behavior described in a pure virtual function, and clarify the differences between an abstract base class and a concrete class. I had to link together a lot of modules and files in order to make the code for this application operate. It was also a helpful revision of the preceding concepts.
Pure virtual functions, abstract base classes, and the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class were all things I was able to learn. I also gained knowledge on how to join several modules and files together.
