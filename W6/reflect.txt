With this advice, I was able to figure out how to duplicate a thing. There are two ways to copy an item, first of all. To copy data, use a function or the "=" operator. Both shallow and deep copies are made throughout the copying process. If a variable with dynamic memory is cloned, shallow copying will still result in a memory leak. Keep in mind that just pointers are transferred when you copy; values are not copied. I used deep copy as a result throughout this session.
I have the ability to read and write files. Throughout this course, I practised reading and writing files as well as insertion and extraction operations. Object references were added to the ostream and istream at this point.
